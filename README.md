### Project Description
[This project is a fun and interactive Funny Excuse Generator. It takes any problem typed by the user and responds with a silly, unrealistic excuse based on certain keywords. If no keyword matches, it shows a random funny excuse. The design is bright, colorful, and made just using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no database or server needed!]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People often need quick excuses — for fun, for jokes, or just to avoid answering seriously.
This project solves the ridiculous “problem” of always needing a creative excuse... even when the situation doesn’t deserve one! ]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[By replacing real solutions with wildly unrealistic excuses! 

Instead of fixing your problem, the website says stuff like:
"My Wi-Fi left me on read."
"My dog needed the keyboard for his online class."

It checks your input for keywords, then throws logic out the window and gives you something that makes no sense... but makes you laugh.
No stress. Just vibes.]
